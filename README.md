## Description

TThis webpage is the first real approach that  I have had regarding programming, after being interested 
but afraid to learn something new and completely different from my profession, in wich, I have been working for 15 years.

I'm really happy and excited about all the new things Im learning and start applying them from the beginning. Right now the main topics are HTML, Github,  CSS, and  Javascript, for now.
I expect from this page when it's done: topics will be added, fine-tuning to the website's look & feel, functionality and interactivity also will evolve into a better webpage as I apply this new knowledge.

## Usage

This prework study guide  has as purpose  to practice the learned knowledge, and to serve as a  structured guide with the basics, concepts  steps, and  commands that right now are the first step we take on this course, but with time I will be able to make part of my workflow in a more fluid way
